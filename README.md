# ETL--Store Data

# Goal

• Determine how subcategory spend was trending over a period of 16
days (3/2/19-3/17/19)
• High level view of each subcategory spend by day
• Look at a granular view of subcategory spend numbers by day
• High level view of spend vs. conversion rates
• Dig deeper to compare conversion rates by Subcategory


# Fidings

• Subcategory C consistently had the highest spend as compared to other
subcategories
• Total spend across all subcategories are always higher on weekends
• Conversion rates stay constant regardless of spend
• Conversion rates are most consistently high for Brd and Trv subcategories a good next step would be to focus on driving more scale there
• Another good step would be to focus on improving CVR on subcategory C, given it already has such high spend
